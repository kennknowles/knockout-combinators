### -- Dependencies ----------------------------------------------------
{ Base, derive }          = require 'boo'
{ concat-map, replicate } = require 'prelude-ls'
{ pick-one, choose-int }  = require './random'


### -- Aliases ---------------------------------------------------------
floor = Math.floor


### -- Interfaces ------------------------------------------------------

#### type Value a
# :: { "generator" -> Generator a
# .. ; "value"     -> a }



### -- Helpers ---------------------------------------------------------

#### λ callable-p
# :internal:
# Checks if something is callable.
#
# :: a -> Bool
callable-p = (a) -> typeof a is 'function'


#### λ generator-p
# :internal:
# Checks if something is a `Generator`
#
# :: a -> Bool
generator-p = (a) -> 'next' of (Object a)


#### λ compute
# :internal:
# Computes a value lifted to a `Generator`.
#
# :: Number -> a -> Generator a -> a
# :: Number -> (a -> b) -> Generator b -> b
compute = (size, a, gen) ->
  | callable-p a => a (size ? gen.size)
  | otherwise    => a


### -- Working with Values ---------------------------------------------

#### λ make-value
# Constructs a `Value` type.
#
# :: a -> Generator a -> Value a
make-value = (value, gen) -->
  generator : gen
  value     : value

#### λ value
# Executes a `Generator` and extracts the generated value.
#
# :: Number -> Generator a -> a
value = (n, ctx, gen) --> ((as-generator gen).next.call ctx, n).value


### -- Core implementation ---------------------------------------------

#### {} Generator
# The base generator logic.
#
# :: Base <| Generator a
Generator = Base.derive {

  ##### Data size
  # A hint for controlling the generated value's complexity.
  #
  # :: Number
  size: 100

  ##### λ next
  # Generates a new random value.
  #
  # :: Number -> Value a
  next: (n) -> ...

  ##### λ shrink
  # Continually shrinks a value into the most minimal case within the
  # context of this generator.
  #
  # :: a -> [a]
  shrink: (a) -> ...

  ##### λ to-string
  # Returns a friendly representation of this generator.
  #
  # By convention (of this library), the friendly names are surrounded
  # by angular brackets to identify them as generators easily.
  #  
  # :: () -> String
  to-string: -> '<Generator>'
}


### -- Combinators for constructing Generators -------------------------

#### λ as-generator
# Lifts a regular value to a `Generator`.
#
# This is used by all combinators to allow users to pass regular values
# as if they were proper `Generators`, making the API cleaner.
#
# :: Generator a -> Generator a
as-generator = (a) -> 
  | generator-p a  => a
  | otherwise      => do
                      Generator.derive {
                        to-string: -> "<#a>"
                        next: (n) -> make-value (compute n, a, this), this
                      }


#### λ choice
# Alternatively generate values from one of the given generators at
# random.
# 
# The values generated from `choice` generators are uniformly
# distributed. You can use the `frequency` generator for weighted random
# choices.
# 
# :: Generator a... -> Generator b
choice = (...as) -> do
                    Generator.derive {
                      to-string: -> "<Choice (#{as})>"

                                   make-value (value n, this, gen), gen
                    }

# Constructs a new `Generator` that alternatively chooses between one of
# the given `Generator`s using a weighted random selection.
#
# :: (Number, Generator a)... -> Generator b
frequency = (...as) -> do
                       gs = concat-map (([w,g]) -> replicate w, g), as

                       (choice ...gs).derive {

                      }


#### λ sized
# Constructs a new `Generator` with a new complexity `size` hint.

                     g.derive { next: (n) -> g.next (f n) }


#### λ recursive
# Constructs a new `Generator` that takes a function or recursive
# generator, and halves the size at each recursive invocation.
#
# The function is late bound, so you can use it for direct and indirect
# recursive generators easily :3
#
# :: (Number -> Generator a) -> Generator b
# :: Generator a -> Generator b
recursive = (gen) -> do
                     Generator.derive {

                     }

                         }
